After some time in the legal field, I've decided to learn software development. In high school, at about the time the internet was gaining popularity, I took a class in HTML and did great and loved it. I surprised myself with how well I did with building a website from scratch. Somehow I choose not to pursue a degree in this field when I entered college. 

Last year I was playing around with codecademy and asked myself why I never thought to pursue this field. For some time now I have wanted to leave the legal field, after some thought and research I decided to really give this a try and landed here. I was hesitant to begin but I reminded myself that if I want to pursue something that I really enjoyed doing while it was challenging to me, I had to just jump in and begin.
